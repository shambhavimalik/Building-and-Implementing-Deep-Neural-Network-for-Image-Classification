# Building-and-Implementing-Deep-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification
- First implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
- Then use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.

We build a 2 layer and an N layer neural Network. These are used to classify images as "Cat" or "Not Cat". The L layer network has better performance.
